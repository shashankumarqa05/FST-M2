•	To manipulate files in the Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS)

Manipulating files in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) involves performing various operations such as uploading files, downloading files, moving files, deleting files, and listing files. You can interact with HDFS using command-line utilities or through programming languages like Python with libraries such as pyarrow or directly using Java APIs. Here’s a guide on how to perform these operations:
Using Command-Line Interface (CLI):
To interact with HDFS from the command line, you typically use the hadoop fs command. Make sure you have the Hadoop binaries installed and configured properly on your system.
1.	List Files:
o	To list files and directories in HDFS:
bash
Copy code
hadoop fs -ls /path/in/hdfs
2.	Upload a File:
o	To upload a file to HDFS:
bash
Copy code
hadoop fs -put /path/to/local/file /path/in/hdfs
3.	Download a File:
o	To download a file from HDFS to the local file system:
bash
Copy code
hadoop fs -get /path/in/hdfs/file /path/to/local/directory
4.	Move a File:
o	To move a file within HDFS (rename):
bash
Copy code
hadoop fs -mv /path/in/hdfs/source /path/in/hdfs/destination
5.	Delete a File:
o	To delete a file from HDFS:
bash
Copy code
hadoop fs -rm /path/in/hdfs/file
6.	Create a Directory:
o	To create a directory in HDFS:
bash
Copy code
hadoop fs -mkdir /path/in/hdfs/new_directory
7.	Remove a Directory:
o	To remove a directory from HDFS (must be empty):
bash
Copy code
hadoop fs -rmdir /path/in/hdfs/directory_to_remove
Using Python with pyarrow Library:
If you prefer to manipulate HDFS files programmatically using Python, you can use the pyarrow library, which provides an interface to interact with HDFS.
1.	Install pyarrow:
bash
Copy code
pip install pyarrow
2.	Example Python Code:
python
Copy code
import pyarrow.fs as fs

# Create an HDFS filesystem object
hdfs = fs.HadoopFileSystem(host='namenode_hostname', port=8020, user='hadoop_user')

# List files
files = hdfs.ls('/path/in/hdfs')
print(files)

# Upload a file to HDFS
with open('/path/to/local/file', 'rb') as f:
    with hdfs.open_output_stream('/path/in/hdfs/uploaded_file') as fout:
        fout.write(f.read())

# Download a file from HDFS
with hdfs.open_input_stream('/path/in/hdfs/file_to_download') as fin:
    with open('/path/to/local/downloaded_file', 'wb') as fout:
        fout.write(fin.read())
o	Replace 'namenode_hostname', 8020, 'hadoop_user', '/path/in/hdfs', etc., with your actual HDFS configuration details.
3.	Additional Operations:
o	The pyarrow library provides methods for various HDFS operations such as renaming files, creating directories, deleting files, etc. Refer to the pyarrow documentation for more details.
Using Java APIs:
If you prefer Java, you can use Hadoop’s Java APIs to interact with HDFS programmatically. Here’s a basic example of how to read and write files in HDFS using Java:
java
Copy code
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.FSDataInputStream;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.FSDataOutputStream;

public class HDFSExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Configuration conf = new Configuration();
        conf.set("fs.defaultFS", "hdfs://namenode_hostname:8020");
        FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(conf);

        // Read file from HDFS
        FSDataInputStream in = fs.open(new Path("/path/in/hdfs/file_to_read"));
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int bytesRead = in.read(buffer);
        System.out.println(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));

        // Write file to HDFS
        FSDataOutputStream out = fs.create(new Path("/path/in/hdfs/file_to_write"));
        out.write("Hello, HDFS!".getBytes());
        out.close();

        fs.close();
    }
}
•	Replace 'namenode_hostname', 8020, '/path/in/hdfs', etc., with your actual HDFS configuration details.
By using these methods, you can effectively manipulate files in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) through different interfaces, whether it’s via command-line tools, Python libraries like pyarrow, or using Java APIs directly. Adjust the examples based on your specific environment and requirements.

MapReduce using Pig on Text File
Performing MapReduce operations using Pig on a text file involves writing Pig Latin scripts to define the operations you want to perform on the data. Pig Latin simplifies the process of writing MapReduce jobs by providing a high-level language to express data transformations. Here’s a step-by-step guide to demonstrate how to use Pig to perform MapReduce-like operations on a text file:
Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Install and Set Up Apache Pig
1.	Install Apache Pig: Download and install Apache Pig on your machine or cluster. Ensure that Pig is configured to run in your environment.

bash
Copy code
pig
Step 2: Write Pig Latin Script
1.	Create a Pig Script File: You can create a .pig script file or directly enter commands into the Pig shell.
2.	Load Data: Load your text file into Pig. For example, if your text file is input.txt:
pig
Copy code
-- Load data from text file
data = LOAD 'input.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (column1:chararray, column2:chararray, ...);
o	Replace column1, column2, etc., with your actual column names or use schema-on-read approach (LOAD 'input.txt' USING PigStorage(',')) if your file is comma-separated.
3.	Transform Data: Perform transformations using Pig Latin commands. Here’s an example of filtering and grouping operations:
pig
Copy code
-- Filter data
filtered_data = FILTER data BY (condition);

-- Group data
grouped_data = GROUP filtered_data BY column1;

-- Perform aggregation (example: count)
result = FOREACH grouped_data GENERATE group AS group_key, COUNT(filtered_data) AS count;
o	Replace (condition) with your actual filtering condition.
4.	Store Results: Store the results in an output file. For example:
pig
Copy code
-- Store results
STORE result INTO 'output_directory' USING PigStorage(',');
o	Replace 'output_directory' with the directory where you want to store the output.
Step 3: Execute Pig Script
1.	Run Pig Script: Save your Pig script file (if applicable) and execute it using the Pig shell:
bash
Copy code
pig -f your_script.pig
o	Replace your_script.pig with the name of your Pig script file.
2.	Monitor Execution: Monitor the Pig job execution in the terminal. Pig will translate your Pig Latin commands into MapReduce jobs and execute them on the Hadoop cluster.
Step 4: View Results
1.	Check Output: After the Pig script completes execution, verify the output in the specified output directory.

•	WordCount using Hive on Text file

Performing a WordCount operation using Hive on a text file involves leveraging Hive's SQL-like syntax to write queries that process text data. Hive provides a convenient way to perform data analysis and transformations using HiveQL (Hive Query Language) without needing to write MapReduce jobs explicitly. Here’s a step-by-step guide to demonstrate how to use Hive for WordCount on a text file:
Prerequisites:
1.	Install and Configure Hive: Ensure that Hive is installed and configured on your Hadoop cluster. Hive requires access to Hadoop's HDFS and a compatible metastore (e.g., Apache Derby, MySQL) configured.
2.	Access to Hadoop Cluster: Make sure you have access to the Hadoop cluster where your text file is stored.
Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Prepare Your Text File
1.	Upload Text File to HDFS: Upload your text file to HDFS using hadoop fs -put command if it's not already there.
bash
Copy code
hadoop fs -put /local/path/to/your/textfile.txt /hdfs/path/to/your/textfile.txt
Replace /local/path/to/your/textfile.txt with the path to your local text file and /hdfs/path/to/your/textfile.txt with the destination path in HDFS.
Step 2: Create a Hive Table
1.	Define External Table: Define an external table in Hive that points to your text file. This table schema should match the structure of your text file.
sql
Copy code
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wordcount_table (
    line STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/hdfs/path/to/your/textfile.txt';
o	Adjust the FIELDS TERMINATED BY and LINES TERMINATED BY clauses based on the actual delimiter and line terminator used in your text file.
Step 3: Perform WordCount Using HiveQL
1.	Write Hive Query: Write a HiveQL query to perform the WordCount operation. In Hive, this typically involves using functions like SPLIT, EXPLODE, and GROUP BY.
sql
Copy code
-- Perform WordCount
SELECT word, COUNT(1) AS count
FROM (
    SELECT explode(split(line, '\\s+')) AS word
    FROM wordcount_table
) words
WHERE word <> ''
GROUP BY word
ORDER BY count DESC;
o	The split(line, '\\s+') function splits each line into words using whitespace as a delimiter.
o	The explode() function flattens the array of words into individual rows.
o	WHERE word <> '' filters out empty strings.
o	GROUP BY word aggregates the counts for each word.
o	ORDER BY count DESC sorts the results by the count in descending order.
Step 4: Execute Hive Query
1.	Run Hive Query: Save the HiveQL query in a .sql file (e.g., wordcount_query.sql) and execute it using the Hive CLI or through tools like Hue or Beeline.
bash
Copy code
hive -f wordcount_query.sql
Alternatively, you can run the query interactively in the Hive CLI or through Hue by entering the query directly.
Step 5: View Results
1.	View WordCount Results: After the Hive query completes execution, you'll see the WordCount results printed to the console or output to a file, depending on how you executed the query.
Example HiveQL Query
Here’s an example of a complete HiveQL query for WordCount:
sql
Copy code
-- Perform WordCount
SELECT word, COUNT(1) AS count
FROM (
    SELECT explode(split(line, '\\s+')) AS word
    FROM wordcount_table
) words
WHERE word <> ''
GROUP BY word
ORDER BY count DESC;
Additional Tips:
•	Performance Optimization: Consider partitioning the data or using bucketing techniques in Hive to optimize performance for larger datasets.
•	Schema Considerations: Ensure your Hive table schema matches the structure of your text file, including delimiters and line terminators.
By following this guide, you can effectively use Hive to perform the WordCount operation on a text file stored in HDFS, leveraging HiveQL to process and analyze data in a SQL-like manner within your Hadoop ecosystem. Adjust the examples based on your specific data characteristics and requirements.
•	Analyzing employee data using Hive. Writing queries in Hive to create a table and insert data and perform various MapReduce operations.
Analyzing employee data using Hive involves creating tables, inserting data, and performing various MapReduce-like operations using HiveQL (Hive Query Language). Below is a step-by-step guide to demonstrate how to analyze employee data using Hive:
Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Create a Hive Table for Employee Data
1.	Define Table Schema: Decide on the schema for your employee data. For example, let's create a table employees with columns emp_id, emp_name, emp_dept, emp_salary, and emp_join_date.
sql
Copy code
-- Create employees table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name STRING,
    emp_dept STRING,
    emp_salary DOUBLE,
    emp_join_date DATE
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
o	Adjust the data types (INT, STRING, DOUBLE, DATE) according to your actual data format.
Step 2: Insert Data into the Hive Table
1.	Load Data into Hive Table: Insert data into the employees table from a CSV file stored in HDFS.
sql
Copy code
-- Load data into employees table
LOAD DATA INPATH '/path/to/your/employees.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE employees;
o	Replace /path/to/your/employees.csv with the HDFS path where your CSV file containing employee data is located.
Step 3: Perform Various MapReduce Operations Using HiveQL
Now, let's perform some common operations on the employees table using HiveQL.
Example Operations:
1.	Select Statement: Retrieve all records from the employees table.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM employees;
2.	Filtering: Retrieve employees who belong to a specific department (e.g., 'IT').
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_dept = 'IT';
3.	Grouping and Aggregation: Calculate average salary by department.
sql
Copy code
SELECT emp_dept, AVG(emp_salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY emp_dept;
4.	Sorting: List employees based on their salary in descending order.
sql
Copy code
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY emp_salary DESC;
5.	Join Operations: Perform a join with another table (assuming you have a departments table).
sql
Copy code
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.emp_dept, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.emp_dept = d.dept_id;
Step 4: Execute Hive Queries
1.	Run Queries: Save the HiveQL queries in a .sql file (e.g., employee_analysis.sql) and execute them using the Hive CLI or through tools like Hue or Beeline.
bash
Copy code
hive -f employee_analysis.sql
Alternatively, you can run the queries interactively in the Hive CLI or through Hue by entering the queries directly.
Step 5: View Results
1.	Review Results: After each query execution, review the results to ensure they meet your analysis requirements.
Example HiveQL Query
Here’s an example of a complete HiveQL query performing a join operation:
sql
Copy code
-- Example: Joining employees and departments
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.emp_dept, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.emp_dept = d.dept_id;
Additional Tips:
•	Data Partitioning: Consider partitioning your data by columns like emp_dept or emp_join_date to improve query performance.
•	Data Bucketing: Use bucketing to organize data into more manageable parts for faster querying.
•	External Tables: If your data is in an external format (e.g., Parquet, ORC), create external tables and use LOCATION to specify the HDFS path.
By following this guide, you can effectively use Hive to analyze employee data stored in HDFS, leveraging HiveQL to perform various MapReduce-like operations for data processing and analysis within your Hadoop ecosystem. Adjust the examples based on your specific data schema and analysis requirements.
•	Establish a connection using it and how to create databases and tables using Beeline
Establishing a connection and creating databases and tables using Beeline involves a series of steps that allow you to interact with Hive from the command line or scripts. Beeline is a command-line interface provided by Apache Hive that uses JDBC to connect to Hive and execute HiveQL commands. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you establish a connection, create databases, and create tables using Beeline:
Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Connect to Hive Using Beeline
1.	Launch Beeline: Open a terminal or command prompt and launch Beeline by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://<hive_server>:<port>/<database> -n <username>
o	Replace <hive_server> with the hostname or IP address of your Hive server.
o	Replace <port> with the port number on which HiveServer2 is listening (default is 10000).
o	Replace <database> with the initial database to connect to.
o	Replace <username> with your Hive username.
Example:
bash
Copy code
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default -n hiveuser
After executing this command, Beeline connects to HiveServer2 using JDBC.
2.	Provide Password (if required): Depending on your Hive configuration, you might be prompted to enter your password after executing the command.
Step 2: Create Databases and Tables Using Beeline
1.	Create a Database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase;
o	Replace mydatabase with the name you want to give your database. The IF NOT EXISTS clause ensures that the database is only created if it does not already exist.
2.	Use the Database:
sql
Copy code
USE mydatabase;
o	Switch to the newly created database to perform operations within it.
3.	Create Tables:
Here’s an example of creating a table in Hive using Beeline:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name STRING,
    emp_dept STRING,
    emp_salary DOUBLE,
    emp_join_date DATE
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
o	Adjust the table schema (employees in this example) and data types (INT, STRING, DOUBLE, DATE) according to your specific requirements.
Step 3: Execute Queries and Commands
1.	Execute HiveQL Commands: With Beeline, you can now execute various HiveQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, ALTER, etc., to interact with your databases and tables.
Example:
sql
Copy code
-- Insert data into employees table
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'IT', 60000.0, '2023-01-15');

-- Query data from employees table
SELECT * FROM employees;
2.	Exit Beeline: To exit Beeline, use the !quit command:
bash
Copy code
!quit
Alternatively, you can use !exit or !q to quit Beeline.
Additional Tips:
•	Secure Authentication: If your Hive installation uses Kerberos authentication or SSL/TLS encryption, adjust the connection URL (-u) accordingly.
•	Script Execution: You can save HiveQL commands in a .sql file and execute them using Beeline with the -f option (beeline -u ... -n ... -f script.sql).
•	Error Handling: Beeline provides detailed error messages and feedback directly in the terminal, which helps in debugging SQL statements.
By following this guide, you can effectively use Beeline to connect to Hive, create databases, create tables, and execute HiveQL commands to manage and query data within your Hadoop ecosystem. Adjust the examples based on your specific Hive configuration and requirements.
•	Using Beeline, participants will connect to a database and load data from CSV files and perform various MapReduce operations
To demonstrate how participants can use Beeline to connect to a database, load data from CSV files, and perform various MapReduce-like operations using HiveQL, here’s a comprehensive step-by-step guide:
Prerequisites:
1.	Hadoop and Hive Setup: Ensure you have Hadoop and Hive installed and properly configured.
2.	CSV Files: Prepare CSV files containing the data that you want to load into Hive tables.
Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Connect to Hive Database Using Beeline
1.	Launch Beeline: Open a terminal or command prompt and launch Beeline by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://<hive_server>:<port>/<database> -n <username>
o	Replace <hive_server> with the hostname or IP address of your Hive server.
o	Replace <port> with the port number on which HiveServer2 is listening (default is 10000).
o	Replace <database> with the initial database to connect to.
o	Replace <username> with your Hive username.
Example:
bash
Copy code
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default -n hiveuser
After executing this command, Beeline connects to HiveServer2 using JDBC.
Step 2: Create Database and Load Data from CSV Files
1.	Create a Database (if not exists):
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase;
o	Replace mydatabase with the name you want to give your database.
2.	Use the Database:
sql
Copy code
USE mydatabase;
o	Switch to the newly created database to perform operations within it.
3.	Create Tables and Load Data:
Assuming you have a CSV file named employees.csv containing employee data (emp_id, emp_name, emp_dept, emp_salary, emp_join_date), here’s how you can create a table and load data from the CSV file:
sql
Copy code
-- Create table employees
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name STRING,
    emp_dept STRING,
    emp_salary DOUBLE,
    emp_join_date DATE
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

-- Load data into employees table from CSV file
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/path/to/employees.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE employees;
o	Adjust the table schema (employees in this example) and data types (INT, STRING, DOUBLE, DATE) according to your CSV file structure.
o	Replace /path/to/employees.csv with the local path to your CSV file. Use LOCAL keyword if the file is on the local file system, or omit it if the file is on HDFS.
Step 3: Perform MapReduce Operations Using HiveQL
1.	Example Operations:
Here are some examples of common MapReduce-like operations using HiveQL:
o	Select Statement: Retrieve all records from the employees table.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM employees;
o	Filtering: Retrieve employees who belong to a specific department (e.g., 'IT').
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_dept = 'IT';
o	Grouping and Aggregation: Calculate average salary by department.
sql
Copy code
SELECT emp_dept, AVG(emp_salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY emp_dept;
o	Sorting: List employees based on their salary in descending order.
sql
Copy code
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY emp_salary DESC;
o	Join Operations: Perform a join with another table (assuming you have a departments table).
sql
Copy code
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.emp_dept, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.emp_dept = d.dept_id;
Step 4: Execute HiveQL Queries and Commands
1.	Run Queries: Save the HiveQL queries in a .sql file (e.g., mapreduce_operations.sql) and execute them using Beeline with the -f option:
bash
Copy code
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://<hive_server>:<port>/<database> -n <username> -f mapreduce_operations.sql
o	Replace <hive_server>, <port>, <database>, and <username> with your Hive server details and credentials.
2.	Interactive Mode: Alternatively, you can run queries interactively by typing them directly into the Beeline prompt.
Step 5: View Results
1.	Review Results: After executing each query, review the results to ensure they meet your analysis requirements.
Additional Tips:
•	Error Handling: Beeline provides detailed error messages and feedback directly in the terminal, which helps in debugging SQL statements.
•	Data Partitioning and Bucketing: Consider partitioning your data or using bucketing techniques in Hive to optimize performance for larger datasets.
•	Script Execution: Beeline allows you to execute scripts containing multiple SQL statements, which is useful for automating tasks or running complex workflows.
By following this guide, participants can effectively use Beeline to connect to Hive, create databases, load data from CSV files, and perform various MapReduce-like operations using HiveQL. Adjust the examples based on specific data schema and analysis requirements.
