Using Informatica to perform a simple Filter Mapping
In Informatica PowerCenter, creating a simple filter mapping allows you to selectively filter rows from a source dataset based on specified criteria, and then load the filtered data into a target dataset. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to perform a simple Filter Mapping in Informatica:
Steps to Create a Simple Filter Mapping in Informatica PowerCenter:
1.	Launch Informatica PowerCenter Designer:
o	Open Informatica PowerCenter Designer client on your workstation.
2.	Create or Open a Mapping:
o	Create a new mapping or open an existing one where you want to apply the filter.
3.	Add Source and Target Definitions:
o	Drag and drop the source and target definitions into the mapping workspace.
	Source Definition: Represents the dataset from which data will be filtered.
	Target Definition: Represents the dataset where filtered data will be loaded.
4.	Add a Filter Transformation:
o	From the Transformation palette, drag and drop a Filter transformation onto the mapping canvas between the source and target.
5.	Connect Source to Filter Transformation:
o	Draw a line from the output of the source qualifier (or source definition) to the input of the Filter transformation.
6.	Configure the Filter Transformation:
o	Double-click on the Filter transformation to open its properties.
o	Define the filter condition in the Filter Transformation Editor:
	Specify the condition based on your criteria. For example, if you want to filter out rows where the Product_Category is not 'Electronics', you would set the condition like:
arduino
Copy code
Product_Category = 'Electronics'
	Click OK to save the filter condition.
7.	Connect Filter Transformation to Target:
o	Draw a line from the output of the Filter transformation to the input of the target definition.
8.	Map Source and Target Columns:
o	Drag columns from the source qualifier (source definition) to the target definition to map them. Ensure that the columns you are mapping are compatible and correctly aligned based on your filter condition.
9.	Validate the Mapping:
o	Validate the mapping to check for any errors or warnings. Resolve any issues that may arise.
10.	Save the Mapping:
o	Once validated, save the mapping in Informatica PowerCenter.
11.	Run the Workflow:
o	Create or open a workflow that contains this mapping.
o	Start the workflow to execute the mapping, which will apply the filter transformation to the source data and load the filtered data into the target.
Example Scenario:
Assume you have a source table Sales_Data with columns Product_ID, Product_Name, Product_Category, Quantity, and Sales_Amount. You want to filter out rows where the Product_Category is not 'Electronics' and load only those rows into a target table Filtered_Sales_Data.
•	Filter Condition: Product_Category = 'Electronics'
Additional Considerations:
•	Complex Filters: Informatica allows you to create complex filter conditions using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and parentheses for grouping conditions.
•	Error Handling: Implement error handling strategies within your workflow to manage any potential issues during execution, such as data type mismatches or null values.
•	Performance Optimization: Consider performance tuning options such as partitioning, session configuration settings (e.g., buffer size), and database optimization for large datasets.
By following these steps, you can effectively create and execute a simple filter mapping in Informatica PowerCenter to filter data based on specified criteria and load the filtered results into a target dataset.

•	Using Informatica to perform Mapping a complex Filter Mapping with the results bring routed through other transformations

Performing a complex filter mapping in Informatica PowerCenter involves setting up a mapping where data passes through multiple transformations, including a Filter transformation, before being routed to the target. This allows you to apply intricate filtering criteria and manipulate data before loading it into the target dataset. Here’s a detailed guide on how to achieve this:
Steps to Create a Complex Filter Mapping in Informatica PowerCenter:
1.	Launch Informatica PowerCenter Designer:
o	Open Informatica PowerCenter Designer client on your workstation.
2.	Create or Open a Mapping:
o	Create a new mapping or open an existing one where you want to apply the complex filtering logic.
3.	Add Source and Target Definitions:
o	Drag and drop the source and target definitions into the mapping workspace.
	Source Definition: Represents the dataset from which data will be filtered.
	Target Definition: Represents the dataset where filtered data will be loaded.
4.	Add Transformations:
o	Drag and drop the necessary transformations onto the mapping canvas. For a complex filter mapping, you might include:
	Filter Transformation: To apply primary filtering conditions.
	Expression Transformation: To derive or manipulate data based on business rules.
	Aggregator Transformation: To perform aggregate calculations if needed.
	Router Transformation: To route data based on different conditions or business logic.
5.	Connect Source to First Transformation:
o	Draw a line from the output of the source qualifier (or source definition) to the input of the first transformation in your sequence (e.g., Filter Transformation).
6.	Configure the Filter Transformation:
o	Double-click on the Filter transformation to open its properties.
o	Define the filter condition(s) based on your complex criteria. For example:
	Use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine multiple conditions.
	Utilize functions and expressions to evaluate complex data transformations.
7.	Connect Transformations:
o	Connect the output of each transformation to the input of the next transformation in your sequence. Ensure the data flow follows the correct logical order based on your mapping requirements.
8.	Map Source and Target Columns:
o	Drag columns from the source qualifier (source definition) to the target definition to map them. Adjust mappings as needed to accommodate transformations applied in between.
9.	Validate the Mapping:
o	Validate the mapping to check for any errors or warnings. Address any issues that may arise during validation.
10.	Save the Mapping:
o	Once validated, save the mapping in Informatica PowerCenter.
11.	Create a Workflow:
o	Create or open a workflow that includes this mapping. Workflows orchestrate the execution of mappings and their associated tasks.
12.	Execute the Workflow:
o	Start the workflow to execute the mapping. This triggers the data flow through the defined transformations, applying complex filtering logic, data manipulation, and routing based on your mapping design.
Example Scenario:
Assume you have a source table Order_Details with columns Order_ID, Product_ID, Quantity, and Order_Date. You want to create a mapping that:
•	Filters out orders where Quantity <= 0.
•	Calculates the total sales amount (Quantity * Unit_Price) using an Expression transformation.
•	Routes orders based on their Order_Date into different target tables (Past_Orders for older orders and Recent_Orders for recent orders).
Additional Considerations:
•	Optimization: Consider optimizing the mapping for performance by using partitioning, increasing buffer sizes, and configuring session properties in Informatica PowerCenter.
•	Error Handling: Implement error handling strategies within your workflow to manage data integrity issues, transformation failures, or other potential errors.
•	Logging and Monitoring: Monitor workflow execution and logging to track data flow, transformation results, and overall job performance.
By following these steps and leveraging Informatica PowerCenter’s capabilities, you can build and execute complex filter mappings that involve multiple transformations, ensuring data meets business requirements before loading it into target datasets.
Using Informatica to perform Mapping with the Lookup Transformation
Performing mapping with the Lookup Transformation in Informatica involves using one or more sources to look up data in another source and then integrate or transform this data as needed. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

Additional Tips:
•	Performance Optimization: Ensure that the database view is optimized for performance, including appropriate indexes and view definitions in the database itself.
•	Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms within the mapping to manage data quality issues or connectivity problems with the database.
By following these steps, you can effectively use a database view as a source in your Informatica mapping, integrating its data with other sources or performing necessary transformations as part of your ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. Adjust configurations based on specific requirements and ensure alignment with your data integration goals.
